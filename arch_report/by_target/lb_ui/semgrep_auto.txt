          Detected a dynamic value being used with urllib. urllib supports 'file://' schemes, so a dynamic    
          value controlled by a malicious actor may allow them to read arbitrary files. Audit uses of urllib  
          calls to ensure user data cannot control the URLs, or consider using the 'requests' library instead.
